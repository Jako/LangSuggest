# LangSuggest

LangSuggest is a language suggest plugin for MODx Revolution that is meant to be
used with Babel. It displays a popup (or something different at the start or the
end of the html body tag), that could redirect the browser to the preferred
language context, when the current context does not contain a browser accepted
language.

### Requirements

* MODX Revolution 2.7+
* PHP 7.3+

### Features

* Show a redirect link to a language context with a browser accepted language
* The content of the popup/bar can be changed by the system settings
