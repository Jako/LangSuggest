## Features

LangSuggest is a language suggest plugin for MODx Revolution that is meant to be
used with Babel. It displays a popup (or something different at the end of the
html body), that could redirect the browser to the preferred language context,
when the current context does not contain a browser accepted language.

The content of the popup and other settings cold be changed by the system settings
in the langsuggest namespace.
